## Project-Actuarial-Statistics-Internal-Model

In this Project, an insurance company internal model is constructed considering life and non-life insurances. The objective of the model is to properly evaluate the premium risk (the risk of having more claims than expected) so the economic capital can be estimated.
The insurance company to be modelled is composed by the following number of policies:
-	Car insurances: 25.234
-	Life insurances: 20.809


For the car claims frequency and severity, the data of last year 1.116 policyholders with 2.230 claims are available. As for the life insurances, the USA-2015 mortality table and the policyholders ages are provided.
The project has three main parts:
1.	Estimation methods validation
2.	Probability density function goodness of fit testing
3.	Aggregated models construction for life and non-life
4.	Montecarlo simulation


With this model, the expected cost will be evaluated together with the VaR (99.5%) and TVaR to quantify the worst-case scenarios.
